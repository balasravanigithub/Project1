By using this model we can get the accuracy of 95.21%.  In order to fill this gap, we proposes a lightweight model with MobileNetV3Large for bird species identification. We use this model innovatively to better capture features of bird sounds at different frequencies. By using the proposed model we can get the accuracy of 98%. We can estimate the bird’s count based on their sound frequencies.
